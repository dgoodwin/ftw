<h1>About</h1>

GT FTW is a community site for Gran Turismo, where users can create, organize, and run their own racing leagues. It is provided free of charge.

The site is currently in very early stages and not yet complete.

<h2>How It Works</h2>

As the site is still under heavy development, not all of this is implemented, this is just the planned/desired functionality at this point in time. (and will probably change frequently for awhile) Feedback is welcome on suggestions and changes you would like to see made.

<h3>Users</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Users join the site via a normal registration process.</li>
  <li>Provide email address, account display name, PSN login, and choose a site password.</li>
  <li>PSN logins will need to be verified by an administrator by sending them a PSN message to prove you own the account.</li>
  <li>Users may have certain privledges associated with their account. (site adminstrator, league administrator, race host, etc) Some of these are site wide, but most are specific to a particular league. League admins will be able to distribute these roles within the league to help spread the workload.</li>
  <li>Will have a dashboard page available showing upcoming events they are scheduled to attend or could register for, recent race results and standings, etc.</li>
  <li>Users will be able to create and join "teams".</li>
</ul>

<h3>Leagues</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Can be created by any user. (who will become initial league admin)</li>
  <li>Leagues are intended to be for a particular type of racing, where all members are expected to be competing against one another on even footing.</li>
  <li>Leagues may be open (anyone can join), or require approval from an admin.</li>
  <li>Members may be granted priviledges within the league to help with the administration process: full league administrator, results approver, race host, etc.</li>
  <li>Leagues may also be configured to limit to a specific geographic area.</li>
  <li>Will support a league blogging feature for news etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Seasons</h3>

<ul>
  <li>A competetive racing season, created within a league.</li>
  <li>Essentially a container for events, and an isolated scoreboard for just that season.</li>
  <li>Season scoring/results may one day feed back into an overall league leaderboard.</li>
  <li>In theory, multiple seasons could be running at any given time.</li>
  <li>Associated with a particular scoring model, see scoring section below.</li>
  <li>Contains a leaderboard of the current standings within that season.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Events</h3>

<ul>
  <li>A season consists of a series of events created by league admins.</li>
  <li>Defines a time and track where the event is to take place.</li>
  <li>Many users can register for the event, once admins schedule the event the field will be split into individual races.</li>
  <li>Qualification process is TBD, really depends on what GT5 offers for functionality.</li>
  <li>For now, all participants are split into races randomly. It would be nice to do this based on skill to keep the racing closer, and give more points to those who succeed in higher races. I do not yet know how to accomplish this however.</li>
  <li>Event also specifies instructions for the race. Currently this is just text, we may add specific options for the more common configuration once the game is release. (PP / tire / drivetrain limitations)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Race</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Once scheduled, an event field is split up into races.</li>
  <li>Will assist with finding a host for each race. League members who have the host role can volunteer to host races. Tools will be available to view races that are still in need of a host.</li>
  <li>Will send appropriate emails to participants to notify them of changes to the race schedule and connection information.</li>
  <li>Will support a comment system.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Race Results</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Assuming GT5 does not offer any direct API to fetch results, must rely on community reporting of results</li>
  <li>Users who participated in the race can submit results.</li>
  <li>League admins (or possibly another role) will be able to approve results, or enter the final results if entries are incomplete.</li>
  <li>Once finalized, race results will affect the season leaderboard.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Scoring</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Scoring system is a very difficult problem, still very unpolished.</li>
  <li>For now, field is split randomly, points are assigned for each position equally regardless if the field was full or not.</li>
  <li>In a simple world where there is only one race, assigning points to positions would be easy.</li>
  <li>Because we support fields larger than a single race, we can still do this, but need to handle situations where each field is not a full 16, and it seems like beating a tougher field may need to be worth more points than beating an easier field.</li>
  <li>This kind of formula could be quite difficult.</li>
  <li>The site may someday support multiple scoring strategies, and league admins can choose which they would like to use.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Other</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The site will audit important approvals.</li>
  <li>Events will be available outside of competetive racing seasons to just coordinate track days and other fun events.</li>
</ul>
